## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Setting Up Next.js Project
1. Create a new Next.js project using `npx create-next-app`.
2. Set up TypeScript and TailwindCSS in the project.

### Step 2: Fetching Figma Component Details
1. Integrate the Figma MCP server to fetch details of the "Desktop - 1" component.
2. Retrieve the structure, styles, and images using the provided component ID.

### Step 3: Building the Component
1. Create a new React component named `Desktop1.tsx`.
2. Implement the structure of the component based on the fetched details:
   - RECTANGLE: Rectangle 1
   - TEXT: MCP SERVER
   - RECTANGLE: Rectangle 2
   - RECTANGLE: Rectangle 3
   - RECTANGLE: Rectangle 4
   - RECTANGLE: Rectangle 5
3. Use TailwindCSS classes to style the component elements according to the Figma design.
4. Ensure all colors, typography, and spacing match the Figma component.

### Step 4: Responsive Design
1. Implement responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints using TailwindCSS utilities.
2. Test the responsiveness of the component on different devices.

### Step 5: Testing and Validation
1. Test the component to ensure it matches the Figma design accurately.
2. Verify that all interactive elements behave as expected.
3. Ensure the text content matches the exact text from Figma.

### Step 6: Final Checks
1. Review the code for any potential improvements or optimizations.
2. Make necessary adjustments to ensure the component is a pixel-perfect match.

## Task 1: Desktop - 1 Implementation
**Description**:
Create a pixel-perfect Next.js implementation of the Figma component.
