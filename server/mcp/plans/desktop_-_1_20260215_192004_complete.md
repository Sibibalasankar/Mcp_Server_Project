### Implementation Plan

#### Overview
The goal is to create a pixel-perfect replica of the Figma component "Desktop - 1" using Next.js 14+, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The component consists of 6 child elements, including rectangles and text, and must be responsive across different devices.

#### Steps

1. **Setup Next.js Project**
   - Create a new Next.js project.
   - Set up TypeScript and TailwindCSS configurations.

2. **Fetch Component Details**
   - Utilize the Figma MCP server to fetch the component details, structure, and styles.
   - Extract colors, typography, and spacing information.

3. **Component Structure**
   - Create a new TypeScript file `components/desktop---1.tsx` to define the component structure.
   - Implement the component structure based on the child elements provided in the Figma component data.

4. **Styling**
   - Use TailwindCSS classes to style the component.
   - Match the exact colors, typography, and spacing from the Figma component.
   - Ensure the layout is responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

5. **Integration**
   - Integrate the component into the main page `app/page.tsx`.
   - Ensure proper alignment and spacing within the page layout.

6. **Testing**
   - Test the component on various devices to ensure responsiveness.
   - Verify that the component visually matches the Figma design.

7. **Refinement**
   - Make any necessary adjustments to achieve pixel-perfect alignment.
   - Fine-tune the styling to match the Figma component accurately.
